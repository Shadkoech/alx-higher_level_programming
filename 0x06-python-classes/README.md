Classes and Object

This folder contains concept on the introduction of Object Oriented programming (OOP). Using different prototypes, I have handled the following:
	=> How to create a class
	=> What is an object and an instance
	=> Data encapsulation
	=> Pythonic way of handling getters and setters
	=> Dynamically creating new attributes
	=> Using private, protected and public attributes
