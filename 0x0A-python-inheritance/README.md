##0x0A. Python - Inheritance
This directory contains exercises and tasks on an important aspect of python as OOP which is inheritance. The concept of inheritance allows us to create a hierarchy of classes that actually share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from its higher class. Some of the key questions answered include:
	* What is a subclass/child/derived class
	* What is a superclass/parent/baseclass for that matter
	* Ways of listing all attributes and methods in a class
	* How to inherit a class from another
	* How to define a class with multiple base classes
	* How to override a method or attribute that is inherited from the base class
	* Purpose and the advantage of inheritance

The tasks handled and the key concept are as follows

###Task 0: Lookup
	- def lookup(obj): - Function used to return a list of available attributes and methods of a given object.

###Task 1: My list
	- def print_sorted(self): - A new child class that inherits from baseclass called list
