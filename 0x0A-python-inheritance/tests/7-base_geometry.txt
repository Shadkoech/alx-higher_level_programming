How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
===============================
This python file has two methods
one implements area calculated and another validates the input value to an integer


importation of the module

        >>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry

Printing out an area

	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> bg.area()
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	Exception: area() is not implemented

Passing a value that is not of type int

	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> bg.integer_validator("name", "k")
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: name must be an integer

Passing a value that is less than 0

	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> bg.integer_validator("name", -7)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: name must be greater than 0

passing a 0

	>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
	>>> bg.integer_validator("name", 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ValueError: name must be greater than 0
