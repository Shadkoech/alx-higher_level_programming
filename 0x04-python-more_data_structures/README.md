This directory holds the exibition of sets and dictionary as data types in python. Herein,the following are covered
	- How to construct and use sets
	- Most common methods of sets and ways of using them
	- When to use sets over lists
	- How to iterate through sets
	- Use of dictionaries and their importance over sets
	- Iterating and the use of dictionaries
	- Use of the following key function in relation to sets and dictionaries:
		1. lambda() function => lambda argument_list: expression
		2. map() function => map(function, sequence)
		3. filter() function => filter(function, sequence)
		4. reduce() function => reduce (function, sequence)






The corresponding tasks and concepts were as follows:
Task 0 => Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
Task 1 => Function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
Task 2 => Function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
Task 3 => Function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
Task 4 => Function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
Task 5 => Function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
Task 6 => Function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
Task 7 => Function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
Task 8 => Function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
Task 9 => Function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
Task 10 => Function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
Task 11 => Function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
Task 13 => Function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple 
Task 14 => Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
Task 15 => Function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
