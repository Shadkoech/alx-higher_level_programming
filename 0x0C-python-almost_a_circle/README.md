## 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

This project amalgamates a number of key Python concepts thus far. These concepts include:
	* Import
	* Exceptions
	* Class
	* Private attribute
	* Getter/Setter
	* Class method
	* Static method
	* Inheritance
	* Unittest
	* Read/Write file

### Files management
Class files are found here:
	* alx-higher_level_programming/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle/models

The files are:
	1. base.py
	2. rectangle.py
	3. square.py

Test modules for the aboves files are found in this path
	* alx-higher_level_programming/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle/tests/test_models

The testfiles include:
	1. test_base.py
	2. test_rectangle.py
	3. test_square.py

The test files follow the unittest testing framework which actually supports and handles test concepts in an object-oriented way. The files contain as many testcases to ensure the validity of the the three created classes

### Classes
This Python project entailed the creation of three classes.
	- Base class which is actually the first and the "base" class
	- Rectangle class which is a derived class of Base class
	- Square class which inherits from both
